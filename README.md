# Student Task/Time Tracker

##### FIT2101 Semester 2 Assignment Project Repository (Team Winkyface)

The task is to create a webapp that can aid tutors in marking students. The aim
of the app is for students to be able to log how much time they have spent on
specific tasks, thus showing their tutor how much time total they have dedicated
to the particular project and giving the tutor information about what the time
was spent doing.
